        “Artificial Intelligence is a bigger concept to create Intelligent Machines that can simulate and act human
        thinking capabilities and <i>behaviors</i>, whereas, Machine Learning is an application of AI that allows machines
        to learn from data without being programmed explicitly”. This course is best suited for students seeking
        to build <strong>world-class</strong> expertise in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and emerging technologies
        which help to grow careers in the upcoming technological era.

        The department offers major courses such as Foundations of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence & Expert Systems,
        Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition, Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning, Cyber Physical Systems.
        Several professional and open elective courses in Applied Machine Learning, Image and Vision Computing,
        Neural Computing and Robotics are also offered as a part of curriculum.
